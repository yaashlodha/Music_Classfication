**Music_Classification**

This automated tool organizes your music library by analyzing song metadata (artist and title) using the Gemini AI API. It intelligently categorizes MP3 files into mood-based folders like Chill, High Energy, or Romance, featuring built-in rate-limit handling and exponential backoff to ensure reliable processing within Free Tier constraints.
